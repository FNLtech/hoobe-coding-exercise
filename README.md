# hoobe-coding-exercise
🚀 Thank you for applying to hoo.be, we are glad you're here! 

🤖 The developers on hoo.be's dev team operate with lots of autonomy, and we hope this coding exercise will give you an opportunity to work independently and show us your skills and familiarity with HTML, SCSS, React, and any other technologies you like to use.

## Output 
🚢 The total time we want you to spend on this is 5 hours. We are not basing your success on how long this takes you, this is meant for us to see your coding style and experience with the different front-end technologies you use.

🏁 Once you have completed the test, please submit a public Github repository, directions on how to view the results, and send us an invoice for your time.

## The exercise
🏗️ Here is a hoo.be page in our development environment: https://devapp.hoo.be/hoobe_coding_exercise. Using React, Nextjs, SCSS, and any other technologies or libraries you like, build a copy of this page. 

### Assets
[The assets](/assets): these will assist you with generating the content on the page.

[Page data](pageData.json): this is API response data that is used to build the page.


🎰 Bonus points: Add your favorite animations, assets, images, or other visual effects you like. Make this your own and show us what you like to build!
